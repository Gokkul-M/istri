## ⏱️ 5-Minute Setup (Do This Now)

### Step 1: Create Database Indexes (5 minutes)

**Why**: Without these, users can't view orders or addresses (you'll see "Database Index Required" errors)

**How**:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/istri-82971/firestore/indexes
2. Click the **"Composite"** tab
3. Click **"Create Index"** and fill in:

**Index 1:**
- Collection ID: `orders`
- Field 1: `customerId` | Ascending
- Field 2: `createdAt` | Descending
- Click Create

**Index 2:**
- Collection ID: `orders`
- Field 1: `laundererId` | Ascending  
- Field 2: `createdAt` | Descending
- Click Create

**Index 3:**
- Collection ID: `disputes`
- Field 1: `customerId` | Ascending
- Field 2: `createdAt` | Descending
- Click Create

**Index 4:**
- Collection ID: `disputes`
- Field 1: `laundererId` | Ascending
- Field 2: `createdAt` | Descending
- Click Create

**Index 5 (Subcollection):**
- Collection ID: `addresses` ⚠️ (just "addresses", NOT "users/{userId}/addresses")
- Query Scope: **Collection group**
- Field 1: `isDefault` | Descending
- Field 2: `createdAt` | Descending
- Click Create

4. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for all indexes to build (they'll show a green checkmark when ready)
5. **Refresh your app** - all errors will disappear!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Database Index Required" Error Still Shows
- **Check**: Did all 5 indexes finish building? (green checkmark in Firebase Console)
- **Fix**: Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- **Wait**: Indexes can take 2-5 minutes to build

### "Collection ID is reserved" Error (For addresses index)
- **Wrong**: `users/{userId}/addresses`
- **Correct**: Just type `addresses`
- **Important**: Select "Collection group" as Query Scope

### Can't Login
- **First time?** You need to signup first
- **Forgot password?** Firebase auth includes password reset
- **Admin?** Use `/admin/login` instead of `/login`

---

## 🚀 Ready to Go Live?

After testing, deploy to production:
1. Create the first admin account (before deploying security rules)
2. Deploy Firestore security rules from `FIRESTORE_RULES.md`
3. Configure Firebase Storage rules
4. Set up custom domain (optional)
5. Enable Firebase App Check for security

See `SETUP_CHECKLIST.md` for the complete production checklist.
