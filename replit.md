## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Core Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for fast development
- Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui component library for consistent UI

**State Management:**
- Zustand for global state management
- React Query for server state
- Custom Firebase hooks for real-time data synchronization

**Navigation & Routing:**
- React Router for client-side routing with role-based protection
- Distinct user portals for Customer, Launderer, and Admin dashboards

**UI/UX Design Patterns:**
- Gradient-based design system (dark navy, lavender, coral, teal)
- Enhanced Switch components, Framer Motion for animations
- Responsive bottom navigation for mobile

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Service:**
- Firebase Authentication with email/password for all users (customers, launderers, admins)

- Firebase Auth state management with custom hooks, logout, and account deletion functionality
- 7-day authentication persistence using `browserLocalPersistence`

**Role-Based Access Control:**
- Three distinct user roles: customer, launderer, admin
- Role-specific UI and feature access, protected routes
- Profile completion flow after signup

### Data Layer

**Firebase Firestore Collections:**
- `users` (profiles, roles, business details)
- `userSettings` (preferences)
- `orders` (items, status, tracking)
- `messages` (customer-launderer communication)
- `services` (laundry service catalog, now global)
- `coupons` (promotional discount codes)
- `disputes` (complaints)
- Addresses subcollection (`users/{userId}/addresses`)

**Real-Time Data Synchronization:**
- Custom hooks for live updates from Firestore using `onSnapshot`
- Role-based query filters and Firestore Security Rules for data security
- Unique order IDs generated by Firestore `addDoc()`
- Critical Firestore composite indexes for efficient queries.

### File Storage

**Firebase Storage:**
- User avatar and business logo uploads in `profile-images/{userId}/{filename}`

### Mobile App Support

**Capacitor Integration:**
- Native iOS and Android app capabilities via Capacitor
- Includes Camera, Geolocation, Push, Haptics, Share, Splash plugins
- Touch-optimized UI and native QR scanning
- `base: './'` in `vite.config.ts` and `HashRouter` for Android compatibility.

### Order Management System

**Order Workflow:**
- Customer order creation (service, items, scheduling)
- Multiple service selection per order
- QR code generation for verification (format: LAUNDRY-{firestoreDocId})
- Launderer acceptance/rejection and processing via a scanner (`/launderer/scan`)
- Real-time status updates (pending → confirmed → picked_up → in_progress → ready → out_for_delivery → completed)
- Invoice generation and download (PDF using jsPDF)
- Post-completion rating and feedback with persistence.
